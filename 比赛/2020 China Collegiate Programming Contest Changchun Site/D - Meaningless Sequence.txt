7-4 D - Meaningless Sequence
Once there was a mathematician, who was obsessed with meaningless number sequences. Here is one of them.

a
​n
​​ ={
​1,
​c⋅max
​0≤i<n
​​ a
​n & i
​​ ,
​​ 
​n=0
​otherwise
​​ ,

where & denotes the bitwise AND operation.

As a mathematician, he could easily tell what a
​n
​​  was for any n, but he wanted to test you. You are required to tell him

(
​i=0
​∑
​n
​​ a
​i
​​ )mod(10
​9
​​ +7)

to convince him that you have a deep understanding of this (although meaningless) sequence.

Input
The only line contains two integers n and c (0≤n<2
​3000
​​ ,0≤c≤10
​9
​​ ).

Specially, n is given in binary presentation. c is given in decimal presentation normally.

Output
Print what you are expected to tell the mathematician normally in decimal presentation.

Example
Input

1000 3
Output
